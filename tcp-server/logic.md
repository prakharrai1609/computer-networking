Here's an explanation of the Go code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"
	"time"
)

// The connect function is responsible for handling each incoming client connection.
func connect(conn net.Conn) {
	// Create a buffer to read incoming data from the client.
	buf := make([]byte, 1024)

	// Read data from the client connection into the buffer.
	n, err := conn.Read(buf)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Extract the actual data received from the client.
	requestData := buf[:n]
	fmt.Println("Received data from client:", string(requestData))

	// Simulate some processing time (5 seconds delay) to demonstrate concurrency.
	time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)

	// Prepare a simple HTTP response.
	response := "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello, World!\r\n"

	// Write the response back to the client connection.
	conn.Write([]byte(response))

	// Close the client connection.
	conn.Close()
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Server started...")

	// Listen for incoming connections on port 8000.
	listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8000")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Continuously accept and handle incoming client connections.
	for {
		// Accept a client connection.
		conn, err := listener.Accept()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		// Start a new goroutine to handle the client connection concurrently.
		go connect(conn)
	}
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `main` function:
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It first prints a message indicating that the server has started.
   - It creates a network listener on TCP port 8000 using `net.Listen`.
   - It enters a loop to continuously accept incoming client connections using `listener.Accept()`.
   - For each accepted connection, it starts a new goroutine to handle the connection by calling the `connect` function.

2. The `connect` function:
   - It takes a `net.Conn` parameter representing the client connection.
   - It creates a buffer to read data from the client.
   - It reads data from the client into the buffer using `conn.Read`.
   - It extracts the actual data received from the client.
   - It simulates some processing time (5 seconds delay) using `time.Sleep`.
   - It prepares an HTTP response indicating "200 OK" and a simple "Hello, World!" message.
   - It writes the response back to the client connection using `conn.Write`.
   - It closes the client connection using `conn.Close()`.

The code essentially sets up a simple TCP server that listens for incoming connections on port 8000. For each client connection, it spawns a new goroutine to handle the connection concurrently, demonstrating a basic example of how to build a concurrent server in Go.
