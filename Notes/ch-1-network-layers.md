# Understanding Networking Layers

To truly understand networking, we need to grasp all the components involved. This includes everything from the cables connecting devices to the protocols facilitating communication between these devices. Several models help explain how network devices communicate, and in this course, we'll focus on a five-layer model. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to identify and describe each layer along with its purpose.

Let's start at the bottom of our stack, where we encounter the **Physical Layer**. This layer represents the physical devices interconnecting computers. It encompasses specifications for networking cables, connectors, and how signals traverse these connections.

Moving up, we have the **Data Link Layer**. This layer might also be referred to as the *Network Interface* or *Network Access Layer*. Here, we introduce our first protocols. While the physical layer deals with cables, connectors, and signals, the data link layer defines a standardized way to interpret these signals, enabling effective communication between network devices. One of the most common protocols at this layer is **Ethernet**, though wireless technologies are also gaining popularity.

Progressing further, we reach the **Network Layer**, which is sometimes called the *Internet Layer*. This layer enables different networks to communicate through devices called routers. An inter-network, such as the famous internet, consists of networks connected via routers. The network layer is responsible for delivering data across a collection of networks. The prominent protocol used here is **IP (Internet Protocol)**.

Moving up the stack, we arrive at the **Transport Layer**. While the network layer facilitates data delivery between individual nodes, the transport layer manages which client and server programs should receive this data. Commonly associated with the term **TCP/IP**, the transport layer relies on protocols like **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**. TCP ensures reliable data delivery, whereas UDP is used when reliability is less critical.

Finally, we come to the **Application Layer**. This topmost layer involves various protocols that are application-specific. Think of browsing the web or sending emailsâ€”these actions involve protocols at the application layer. These protocols are likely the most familiar since they're ones you've likely interacted with directly.

To visualize these layers, imagine the process as a package being delivered:
- The *Physical Layer* represents the delivery truck and the roads.
- The *Data Link Layer* manages how the delivery trucks move between intersections.
- The *Network Layer* determines the routes from address A to address B.
- The *Transport Layer* ensures the delivery driver knows how to inform you of a package's arrival.
- The *Application Layer* contains the actual contents of the package.

Understanding these layers is fundamental to comprehending networking as a whole.
